# Pose Estimation For Unity
A vision pipeline for 2D/3D pose estimation in unity.

The **main.py** file may be called from unity to extract the human pose key points using the system's webcam.

This project employs [Facebook's Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) pretrained models
and libraries for extraction of human pose key points from images. For corresponding terms of licence please 
refer to [the Detectron2's licence page here.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/LICENSE)
